examples to be used for future student projects.\n\nThe Android development

Widget\". This application, showing statistics for the xbox live gamer network
using the official Microsoft developers API, was engineered, designed and
implemented from scratch. In this process we have encountered several mobile
development aspects such as third party API authorization negotiations, API
usage and feed-parsing, Android Developer enrollment, Android-Market
publishing, user feedback, error reporting and version updating.\n\nDeep-diving
into the world of mobile development resulted in a wide variety of challenges
on different levels. After learning and comprehending the complex workflow of
the Android framework, we had to deal with real end-users and used their
(mostly harsh) feedback to improve the application and create a more stable
product. \n\nThe clear usage goal in a unique market niche, close relation to
the applications users, updates with feature requests and bug fixes caused the
application to be downloaded over 100.000 times and it is actively being used
by over 20.000 Android users (as of 01-09-11).",
